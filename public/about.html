<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi,
  Myself Albert Mathews Johnson from Kerala. I had done my B.Tech in Computer Science from CMJ university on 2012. Then I worked on various jobs at different places such as Orissa, Hyderabad etc. The last job I worked was for Mining & Geology Department of Kerala state as a techinical support person for the Department's website. There my work included to attend the calls of public and give them proper directions on how to use the website properly. It was a contract based job and the period of the contract was for one year. I joined the office on 2018 and the Department extended my contract every year through different sub-contractor companies since I was not a Govt. employee. That is why I do not have proper documentation to support my claim.</p>

<p>Even though I was getting a decent salary but I was not satisfied with the job which I was doing. So I joined The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr.Angela Yu.
  Here I have learned HTML properly from the basics. And through HTML I am creating this portfolio website.</p>

<p>I am grateful to Dr.Angela Yu for building my skills properly and directing me to the right path.</p>
